# Customer Segmentation and Personalization

## Overview

Developed a K-means clustering model for customer segmentation and personalization in an e-commerce context. Utilized PCA for dimensionality reduction and WCSS for cluster validation, identifying three customer groups with similar preferences and behaviors.

## Key Features

- **Data Preparation and Cleaning:** Processes the Online Retail Dataset, handles missing values, and transforms data into a suitable format for analysis.
  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts relevant features, such as purchase history, order frequency, and total spending, to capture customer behavior.

- **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:** Applies PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while retaining informative features.

- **K-means Clustering:** Utilizes K-means clustering to group customers based on their feature values.

- **Cluster Profiling:** Profiles each cluster by calculating cluster-specific metrics like average spending, purchase frequency, and popular product categories.

- **Visualization:** Visualizes clusters using scatter plots to understand the distribution and overlap of customers.

- **Evaluation:** Evaluates the quality of clustering results using silhouette score and within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).

- **Personalization and Recommendations:** Develops personalized marketing strategies and recommendations based on identified customer segments.

- **Interpretation and Insights:** Interprets the results, provides insights about different customer segments, and discusses implications for the e-commerce business.
